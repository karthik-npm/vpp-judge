## ***Dates***

All dates should be in the format with a 2-digit month, 2-digit day, and 4-digit year.

* **MM/DD/YYYY**

All dates should be in bold format, with the exception of dates found as a subbullet.  
If two or more source documents have the same date, individual events should be created within the oncological history.  
Please refer to the Biomarkers section of this manual for instructions on documenting certain biomarker dates that include both genomic and genetic results.

*Date Formatting is as below:*

*Date with subbullet*

- MM/DD/YYYY: Started medication  
  - MM/DD/YYYY: Medication held due to side effects

### ***No or Partial Dates and Seasons***

If a partial date is known, missing information can be excluded. For example, if only the month and year are available, the day can be excluded. If only the year is known, the month and day can be excluded.  
If a definite date or descriptive term is not included or if there are no descriptive terms available, write "??"  
If no date is found correlating to an event (i.e. MD note states CT imaging completed with no correlating source document), the VPP should make every effort using source documents to recover the missing information.  
If the VPP is unable to recover the missing documents or information, an escalation form for missing documents/information should be submitted, and the VPP should follow their site-specific guidelines for reporting missing documents or information.  
Utilize the following months to approximate for seasons of the year (e.g. if the year were 2020 then the following seasons would be written like the final date bolded below):

* January \> Winter \> **01/2020**  
* April \> Spring \> **04/2020**  
* July \> Summer \> **07/2020**  
* October \> Fall \> **10/2020**

## ***Other***

If the patient has treatments including multiple drugs, the use of the term "and" is acceptable. The use of symbols (+, &, etc.)  is not acceptable.
