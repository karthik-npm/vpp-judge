# **Virtual Physician Partner Manual**

# Purpose

Virtual Physician Partner (VPP) Note Preparation and Scribe services at N-Power Medicine (NPM) enable physicians to focus on patient care by alleviating the burden of documentation. Using a secure, HIPAA-compliant remote connection, VPPs provide note preparation and real-time data entry into the electronic medical record (EMR) system.  
This manual serves as the foundational guide and key training resource for Virtual Physician Partner (VPP) Note Preparation services at NPM. The objective is to establish a standardized approach to note preparation and virtual scribe as well as offer a baseline content level for all VPPs.

# Significance

VPPs play an integral role in providing standardized documentation for physicians so that clinical care is streamlined. Secondarily, documentation will provide NPM with accurate and concise timelines of patient care to further streamline data abstraction, which can potentially open the doors for clinical trial matching software, AI augmentation and future projects aligned with NPM’s goals.

# Source Documents

Source Documents contain clinical documents for patient care such as clinical notes, pathology, radiology and imaging reports which support the note preparation process. Source documents are critical to creating an accurate patient history. Below are some examples of source documents:

| Document | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| *MD Note* | Primary tool used to document care, communicate plans, and provide guidance for follow-up treatment and care This includes: Oncology/Hematology, Radiation Oncology, Hospitalization Records, etc. |
| *Radiology Report* | Documentation of the interpretation of a radiology procedure, including impression and findings |
| *Lab Report* | Blood tests or blood panels performed to check a variety of values and/or tumor/biomarkers |
| *Pathology Report* | The description of cells and tissues made by a pathologist based on microscopic evidence, and sometimes used to make a diagnosis of a disease. |
| *Cancer Genomics Report* | Genomics generally refers to the study of mutations in genes that may drive various cancer behaviors, from how aggressive it is to whether it spreads to distant locations in the body |
| *Nurse Notes* | Part of a patient’s medical record where nurses communicate with other medical staff the care that was administered to a patient.  May be, but not limited to medication administration, patient assessment, or implementation of a medical intervention |
| *Medication Administration Record* | Medication Administration Record, houses information of medications administered by the clinic staff (usually nurses). May be handwritten (MAR) or electronically documented (eMAR) |
| *EHR as a Source* | Examples: Patient Summaries, Treatment Plans, etc. |
| *Other Clinical Documentation* | Examples: Procedure Notes, Operation Reports, Prescriptions, Referrals, Phone calls, etc. |

# Note Preparation Process, General Guidelines, and Workflow

## ***Purpose***

Note Preparation documents the patient’s complete medical oncological history, from diagnosis to treatments, and beyond. Note Preparation serves as a way for medical oncologists and other medical professionals to view the patient’s history in an accurate and concise manner. The VPP Note is composed of two parts: The One-Liner and The Oncological History.

## ***Significance***

Note Preparation reduces the burden of documentation of patient’s histories and present events for the physician, allowing more time spent with patients and developing care plans for each.

## ***Workflow and Expectations***

The VPP is expected to:

* Scour source documents to locate information regarding a patient’s oncological journey  
* Use the information found to formulate a complete and accurate history of events according to the guidelines and rules outlined in this document and physician preferences  
* Complete quality note preparation in a timely manner for their assigned physician(s) according to the guidelines outlined here and on physician preferences

## ***Components***

* **One-Liner:** Provides a concise, accurate, and current summary of the patient’s cancer history  
* **Oncological History:** Serves as an accurate, concise bulleted medical history of the patient’s cancer-related history

# Important Concepts to Note

## ***Metastatic Status***

Metastatic Status refers to the prognostic group Stage IV. The patient will **not** return to a non-metastatic state after confirmation of Stage IV disease, even after treatment. A patient can have de novo metastatic disease, or metastatic disease. Metastatic disease can occur as progression or as recurrence.  
**De novo metastatic disease** refers to cancer that was metastatic at the time of initial diagnosis, meaning the spread was detected when the primary tumor was *first* discovered.  
**Metastatic disease** indicates that the cancer spread to distant sites *after* a period of time following the initial diagnosis and treatment of a localized cancer.

## ***Histology/ Histopathology/Pathology***

The terms histology, histopathology, and pathology are, at times, used interchangeably, however do possess slightly different meanings.

- Histology is the study of the microscopic anatomy of tissues, including their structure and cellular composition, regardless of disease state.  
- Histopathology is the study of *diseased* tissues under a microscope.  
- Pathology is the broader medical field that studies the causes, mechanisms, and effects of diseases on the body, including *analysis of tissues* (histopathology) and other bodily fluids.

All histopathology is considered histology, but not all histology is histopathology. Histology is used in research as well as clinical diagnosis, while histopathology is primarily used for diagnostic purposes.

## ***Multiple Primaries***

Multiple primary cancers (MPCs) occurs when a patient has two or more primary cancers (distinct histopathology) in the same or different organs or tissues. The cancers can be synchronous, meaning they occur at the same time, or metachronous, meaning they occur at different times.  
Formatting for patients with multiple primary cancer diagnoses is explained in the sections below.

# General Formatting

The following concept should be in bold formatting:

* **Disease Header**

The following concepts and specific terms (designated by "XYZ") should be in bold formatting:

* **Dates**  
* **"Date of Diagnosis" (DOD)**  
* **Histopathology**  
* **Stage/TNM**  
* **Treatment name/regimen**  
* **"Recurrence"/"Progression"/"Metastasis"**

## ***Dates***

All dates should be in the format with a 2-digit month, 2-digit day, and 4-digit year.

* **MM/DD/YYYY**

All dates should be in bold format, with the exception of dates found as a subbullet.  
If two or more source documents have the same date, individual events should be created within the oncological history.  
Please refer to the Biomarkers section of this manual for instructions on documenting certain biomarker dates that include both genomic and genetic results.

*Date Formatting is as below:*

*Date with subbullet*

- MM/DD/YYYY: Started medication  
  - MM/DD/YYYY: Medication held due to side effects

*Same date with multiple source documents*

- MM/DD/YYYY: CT scan showed...  
- MM/DD/YYYY: Biopsy pathology consistent with...

### ***No or Partial Dates and Seasons***

If a partial date is known, missing information can be excluded. For example, if only the month and year are available, the day can be excluded. If only the year is known, the month and day can be excluded.  
If a definite date or descriptive term is not included or if there are no descriptive terms available, write "??"  
If no date is found correlating to an event (i.e. MD note states CT imaging completed with no correlating source document), the VPP should make every effort using source documents to recover the missing information.  
If the VPP is unable to recover the missing documents or information, an escalation form for missing documents/information should be submitted, and the VPP should follow their site-specific guidelines for reporting missing documents or information.  
Utilize the following months to approximate for seasons of the year (e.g. if the year were 2020 then the following seasons would be written like the final date bolded below):

* January \> Winter \> **01/2020**  
* April \> Spring \> **04/2020**  
* July \> Summer \> **07/2020**  
* October \> Fall \> **10/2020**

## ***Other***

If the patient has treatments including multiple drugs, the use of the term "and" is acceptable. The use of symbols (+, &, etc.)  is not acceptable.

# One-Liner

## ***Purpose***

The one-liner provides a concise, accurate, and current summary of the patient’s cancer history. There are two one-liners integrated within the VPP prepped note: the brief one-liner and the detailed one-liner.

## ***Significance***

The one-liner presents the patient’s past and current status of oncological information and events, allowing the reader to have a concise, yet comprehensive picture of the patient’s cancer journey, from diagnosis to current.

## ***Brief One-Liner***

The Brief One-Liner is typically found paired with the patient’s Oncological History. The elements included in the Brief One-Liner are:

* Age  
* Gender (Male/Female)  
* Histopathology (specific)  
* Site/Laterality  
* Metastatic Status (only if Stage IV)  
* Current Treatment(s), Follow-up, or Surveillance

*Brief One-Liner Formatting:*

*Non-metastatic:*  
Name is a Age year old Gender with a history of Histopathology of the Site/Laterality. Currently on Treatment/Follow-up/Surveillance.

*Metastatic de novo:*  
Name is a Age year old Gender with a history of "Metastatic" Histopathology of the Site/Laterality. Currently on Treatment/Follow-up/Surveillance.

*Metastatic progression or recurrence:*  
Name is a Age year old Gender with a history of Histopathology of the Site/Laterality, "now with metastasis". Currently on Treatment/Follow-up/Surveillance.

## ***Detailed One-Liner***

The Detailed One-Liner is found paired with the Assessment and Plan. The elements included in the Detailed One-Liner are:

* Age  
* Gender (Male/Female)  
* Biomarkers  
* Stage and/or TNM at *diagnosis*  
* Grade  
* Histopathology  
* Site/Laterality  
* Past Cancer Directed Therapies (s/p)  
* Metastatic Status (only if Stage IV)  
* Current Treatment(s)/Follow-up or Surveillance

*Detailed One-Liner Formatting:*

*Non-metastatic:*  
Name is a Age year old Gender with a history of Biomarkers, Stage (TNM), Grade, Histopathology of the Site/Laterality, s/p Treatment. Currently on Treatment/Follow-up/Surveillance.

*Metastatic de novo:*  
Name is a Age year old Gender with a history of "Metastatic" Biomarkers, Stage (TNM), Grade, Histopathology of the Site/Laterality, s/p Treatment. Currently on Treatment/Follow-up/Surveillance.

*Metastatic progression or recurrence:*  
Name is a Age year old Gender with a history of Biomarkers, Stage (TNM), Grade, Histopathology of the Site/Laterality, s/p Treatment, now with metastasis. Currently on Treatment/Follow-up/Surveillance.

*Metastatic progression or recurrence, with additional treatment:*  
Name is a Age year old Gender with a history of Biomarkers, Stage (TNM), Grade, Histopathology of the Site/Laterality, "now with metastasis," s/p Treatment. Currently on Treatment/Follow-up/Surveillance.

## ***One-Liner Element Guidelines***

### ***Missing Information***

If any of the elements required for the one-liner are not found or identified when you are reviewing the patient’s chart, the VPP should make every effort using source documents available to recover the missing information.

### ***Biomarkers***

The following disease specific biomarkers should be included in the one-liner for all patients with the following diagnosis:

* Breast: ER, PR, HER2, BRCA1/2  
* Colorectal: CEA, TMB, MSI, MMR, APC, NRAS, KRAS  
* NSCLC: PD-L1, EGFR, ALK, ROS1  
* Prostate: PSA, BRCA2

### ***Metastatic Status***

The term "metastatic" will be used in the one-liner if and only if the patient is considered to have Stage IV metastatic disease. There will be **no** inclusion of the term "non-metastatic" in the one-liner if the patient is not exhibiting Stage IV metastatic disease.  
**Metastatic de novo:** The patient does exhibit metastasis at the time of diagnosis (de novo), use the quantifier metastasis before histopathology.  
**Metastatic progression or recurrence:** The patient does not exhibit metastasis at the time of diagnosis (non-metastatic Stage I-III), but now has metastatic disease, use the quantifier "now with" metastasis after Site/Laterality.  
**Non-metastatic:** The patient does not exhibit metastasis at the time of diagnosis and continues to have no evidence of metastatic disease, no mention of metastatic status is made in the one-liner.

### ***Current Treatment/Follow-up/Surveillance***

Current treatment for the sake of the VPP Manual refers to ongoing cancer directed treatment.  
Follow-up care is usually for cancer survivors who will return for regular oncological check-ups once treatment is complete and remission is achieved. For the one-liner, this will also refer to ongoing workup and treatment planning. In these instances, the one-liner should reflect "Currently on follow-up."  
Surveillance is usually for patients with active cancer, and consists of closely monitoring a patient's condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse.

### ***Past Cancer Directed Therapies***

If a patient has had multiple cancer directed treatments, brief descriptions of each treatment are acceptable. For example if the patient had a right breast lumpectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy, acceptable formatting would be "right lumpectomy with SNLB."  
If the patient has tried many treatments, such as multiple oral medications of the same class, but they were discontinued due to side effects, include "trial of multiple drug class(es) without completion."  
If the patient has undergone therapy, and was subsequently diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic disease, the one-liner should outline these events in chronological order. See below for formatting details.

### ***Multiple primaries***

If the patient has a history of multiple primary diagnoses of cancer, the one-liners and oncological history should be presented in reverse chronological order based on date of diagnosis in separate paragraphs.  
If both primary diagnoses are being treated with the same treatment, the one-liners should be in the same paragraph, with Currently on Treatment at the end of both one-liners.

*Multiple Primaries Formatting:*

*Multiple Primaries:*  
Name is a Age year old Gender with a history of Histopathology of the Site/Laterality, "now with metastasis". Currently on Treatment. They also have a history of Histopathology of the Site/Laterality, "now with metastasis". Currently on Treatment/Follow-up/Surveillance.

*Multiple Primaries with same treatment:*  
Name is a Age year old Gender with a history of Histopathology of the Site/Laterality, "now with metastasis". They also have a history of Histopathology of the Site/Laterality, "now with metastasis". Currently on Treatment/Follow-up/Surveillance.

### ***Inclusion/Exclusion of the One-Liner***

Depending on provider preference, one or both one-liners may or may not be included in the patient’s VPP prepped note. For example, The Brief One-Liner is typically found paired with the Oncological History, while the Detailed One-Liner is typically found in the Assessment and Plan, however, some providers may prefer the Detailed One-Liner paired with the Oncological History.

# Oncological History

## ***Purpose***

The oncological history serves as an accurate, concise bulleted medical history of the patient’s cancer-related history, i.e. the "patient’s story." This history is a crucial component of the overall medical assessment and decision making.

## ***Significance***

The oncological history should provide a detailed storyline from the patients presenting symptoms, their work up, and treatments received allowing medical providers and other healthcare professionals to find important information about the patient with ease.

## ***Disease Header***

The disease header introduces the patient’s cancer diagnosis as the general cancer type (i.e. breast, lung, etc), not the specific histopathology (i.e. IDC, NSCLC, etc.). It serves as a differentiator should the patient have more than one oncological diagnosis of the same cancer type (i.e. breast cancer and colon cancer).  
Formatted in **bold** and is positioned below the one-liner, above the bulleted oncological history.  
If the patient has cancer in bilateral organs, such as bilateral breast cancer, the laterality should be specified in the disease header (i.e. Right breast cancer and Left breast cancer), and should follow rules for multiple primaries.

## ***Bulleted History***

The bulleted history serves as a detailed timeline of a patient’s oncological history. Entries within the oncological history are presented in chronological order with each entry contributing value to the patient’s history.  
The bulleted history will include the following components, as applicable:

* Presenting Symptoms  
* Diagnostic/Staging Workup  
* Date of Diagnosis and Pathology  
* Treatment(s)  
* Follow-up or Surveillance  
* Evidence of Recurrence/Progression/Metastasis

### ***Presenting Symptoms***

Should be presented with a date followed by a description of the symptoms or incidental findings that prompted further evaluation by a hematologist or medical oncologist.  
Presenting symptom events should include: date of occurrence and description of symptom(s) experienced, or date of and summary of incidental finding(s).  
Please review how hospitalizations should be handled below.

### ***Diagnostic/Staging Workup***

Includes all diagnostic radiology, laboratory testing, and biopsies with their resulting histopathology.  
All workup events, as applicable, should include:

* Date Completed  
* Diagnostic Test Name  
* Summary of Findings (Impression, Lab Results, etc.)

Summary of information includes only information relevant to the cancer diagnosis.

#### ***Imaging***

Imaging events should include the impression along with measurements and locations of abnormal findings related directly to the cancer diagnosis.

MM/DD/YYYY: Test name showed… \[summary of findings\]

### 

#### ***Biomarker Testing***

Biomarker testing, in oncology, refers to the analysis of DNA, RNA, proteins, and other substances in specimens that can provide information about cancer. Some biomarkers are assessed in the tumor tissue and others can be assessed in blood.  
Guidelines for certain indications will be documented for all patients are found in the Biomarkers section of this document  
For biomarker testing, the event should include:

* Collection Date  
* Vendor  
* Test Type with descriptors  
* Specimen Type  
* Technique  
* Findings

There are times when a physician will request testing on a sample from the patient's diagnostic tissue or other tissue samples. In this instance, the testing result will be documented as a subbullet below the date of collection of the tissue (usually the biopsy or surgical collection date). The reported date of the tissue sample is used for documenting the results. This date should be bolded.  
*Biomarker Testing Formatting:*

*Testing on previously sampled tissue:*

- 01/01/2020: Biopsy pathology consistent with...  
  - 03/01/2020: Vendor, Test Type, Specimen, Findings

*Testing on blood sample:*

- MM/DD/YYYY: Vendor, Test Type, Specimen, Findings

### ***Date of Diagnosis and Initial Pathology***

The Date of Diagnosis (DOD) as outlined in the Core Variables section of this manual, corresponds to the collection date of the *initial* pathology specimen indicating malignancy. This phrase will be integrated into the event containing the first instance of identified malignancy.  
The date of diagnosis is most often associated with a diagnostic biopsy, but can also be derived from a surgical pathology report or imaging alone.  
If imaging alone is used as the Date of Diagnosis, it must be confirmed by the physician in their Assessment and Plan.  
The event should be as detailed as possible, as applicable.  
Biopsy Pathology events should include:

* Collection Date  
* Specimen Source  
* Histologic Type  
* Grade (if applicable)  
* Biomarkers  
* Additional comments and/or interpretations made by the pathologist

Surgical Pathology events should include:

* Collection Date  
* Procedure Name  
* Specimen Source

* Lymphovascular, Perineural or Vascular Invasion  
* Margins  
* Lymph Node Involvement  
* Biomarkers  
* Stage and TNM  
* Additional comments and/or interpretations made by the pathologist

"Consistent with" will be the descriptive phrase used to describe the pathology of a tissue.

Systemic therapy most commonly refers to systemic anti-cancer therapies (SACT) like chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc.  
**Radiation Therapy** Events should include:

* Start Date or Date Range  
* Type of Radiation  
* Site and Laterality  
* Total Dose (Gy)  
* Total Fractions (fx)

The type of radiation therapy should be included in the description unless such information is unavailable. Examples of types of radiation therapy are: EBRT (IMRT, SBRT \[Y-90\], etc.), Brachytherapy, TBI. This should be as descriptive as possible, as applicable.  
**Surgical Event** Guidelines for documentation is found in the Date of Diagnosis and Initial Pathology section of this document.

\*\* Modification refers to a change in treatment or therapy with a dose reduction, substitution or discontinuation of one or more drugs

### ***Follow-up or Surveillance***

Follow-up care is usually for cancer survivors who will return for regular medical check-ups once treatment is complete and remission is achieved. Surveillance is usually for patients with active cancer, and consists of closely monitoring a patient's condition but not prescribing any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse.  
*For patients on follow-up or active surveillance the bulleted history should include **imaging or lab tests used to monitor for disease recurrence.***  
Only the *most recent* imaging results should be included for patients on follow-up or surveillance, unless a positive or abnormal finding is identified.

- MM/DD/YYYY-MM/DD/YYYY: Completed Treatment Name/Regimen x \# of cycles  
- MM/DD/YYYY-MM/DD/YYYY: Test name with imaging summary (i.e. no evidence of disease) and/or trending lab results

### ***Recurrence, Progression, Metastasis***

Recurrence, Progression and Metastasis is often found on follow-up or surveillance scans. However, it can, at times, be inferred as a result of side effects in combination with clinical evaluation. These findings should be confirmed by the physician within the patient’s assessment and plan for it to be considered as such. The terms should only be bolded in these instances.  
The terms "Recurrence," "Progression," or "Metastasis" may be found on radiology reports or within the MD Note after MD review of radiology reports.  
The MD may disagree with a radiologist ***report*** of Recurrence, Progression, Metastasis, in these instances these terms should ***not*** be bolded.  
The MD may disagree with a radiologist ***non-report*** of Recurrence, Progression, Metastasis, in these instances these terms ***should*** be bolded.  
*Recurrence* refers to cancer that has come back after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected (remission). Recurrence can be Local, Regional, or Distant. Only the term "**Recurrence**" should be bolded.  
*Progression* refers to cancer that has become worse or spread in the body without having a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected. Only the term "**Progression**" should be bolded.  
*Metastasis* refers to cancer that has spread to other parts of the body beyond the primary site. Only the term "**Metastatic**" or variations of this term should be bolded.

### ***Hospitalizations***

If the patient was hospitalized or seen in the Emergency Department (ED) for their presenting symptoms and found to have cancer during their hospitalization, or was hospitalized for any reason that causes a change in cancer directed therapy, the dates of admission and a summary of events should be included in note prep.  
If the Date of Diagnosis occurred during the hospitalization, the event should be included as a bullet outside of the dates of admission.  
Information for hospitalizations that should be documented includes: Date(s) of ER Visit or Hospitalization, Hospital Name, Summary of Presenting Symptoms, and Workup including labs, imaging, etc. The date of these events should be included within the summarized bullets as outlined below.  
*Hospitalization Formatting:*

*Date of Diagnosis during Hospitalization*

- MM/DD/YYYY-MM/DD/YYYY: The patient was admitted to the hospital for complaints of presenting symptoms, Imaging on MM/DD/YYYY showed findings.  
- MM/DD/YYYY: Date of Diagnosis, Pathology results…

*General Hospitalization Resulting in Change in Cancer Directed Therapy*

- MM/DD/YYYY-MM/DD/YYYY: The patient was admitted to the hospital for complaints of presenting symptoms, Imaging on MM/DD/YYYY showed findings.

### ***Long/Extensive History***

If a patient's history extends past five years from date of diagnosis, information and findings from the period of events including presenting symptoms, diagnostic workup, and follow-up can be summarized in one bullet. The Date of Diagnosis, Treatment History, Evidence of Recurrence, Progression or Metastasis should always be included as separate bullets.

# NPM Core Variables

NPM values high quality data collection and curation, and has identified seven core variables: Date of Diagnosis, Primary Site, Histological Type, Laterality, Metastatic Status, Biomarkers and Medical Oncology (Treatments including Systemic Therapy, Surgery, and Radiation Therapy).  
VPPs hold a responsibility to capture these variables for every patient encounter. The VPP should follow the guidelines and hierarchies outlined below to capture the necessary data. Formatting and information required to capture for these variables is found within the above sections of this document.

## ***Date of Diagnosis (DOD)***

The Date of Diagnosis corresponds to the collection date of the initial pathology specimen indicating malignancy. If the original pathology report is unavailable, alternative source documents are used to establish the Date of Diagnosis (i.e. Imaging or MD Note)  
There are rare times where biopsy is not feasible and diagnosis will be made on imaging, labs and/or medical assessment alone.

### ***Hierarchy of Documents***

Record the Date of Diagnosis based on the following hierarchy of source documents (dependent on availability):

1. **Pathology Report**  
   1. Use the pathology report (biopsy or surgical) as the primary source of truth to derive Date of Diagnosis  
   2. Use the "Collected Date," not the report date  
   3. This may be derived from a cytology, biopsy or surgical pathology report  
2. **MD Note**  
   1. In the instance a biopsy was not performed, the imaging completion date may be used to produce the Date of Diagnosis, however, the MD Note must confirm in the assessment and plan

## ***Primary Site***

The Primary Site is typically derived from a biopsy or surgical pathology report. It describes the original location where a tumor develops and originates (staining patterns, etc.).

### ***Hierarchy of Documents***

Record the Primary Site based on the following hierarchy of source documents:

2. **Pathology Report**  
   1. Use the pathology report as the primary source of truth to derive Primary Site  
   2. This may be derived from a biopsy or surgical pathology report  
   3. In the instance of an addended initial pathology report, the addendum should be used as the primary site  
   4. The use of ambiguous terms in the Pathology Report can be used to determine the primary site  
2. **MD Note**  
   1. The physician may reference the Primary Site in their assessment and plan  
   2. This can be used to derive the Primary Site  
2. **ICD-10 C Code**  
   1. Use of the ICD-10 C-Code

## ***Histological Type***

The Histological Type is derived from a biopsy or surgical pathology report. It describes the type of tissue in which the cancer originated and refers to the growth pattern of the tumor.  
There are rare times where obtaining a specimen for pathological evaluation is not feasible and the histological type is not available for specific histology. In these instances a general cancer type can be derived from clinical evaluation (labs, imaging, evidence of metastatic (Stage IV) disease). For example, a 50 year old male presenting with a PSA of \>200, bony metastatic disease, and a prostate tumor identified by diagnostic imaging will lead to a clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer by the medical oncologist.

### ***Hierarchy of Documents***

Record the Histologic Type based on the following hierarchy of source documents:

2. **Pathology Report**  
   1. Use the pathology report as the primary source of truth to derive Histological Type  
   2. This may be derived from a cytology, biopsy or surgical pathology report  
2. **MD Note**  
   1. If the medical oncologist mentions a specific cancer type as the primary and/or is treating as a certain cancer type, it can be used to derive the Histological Type

## ***Laterality***

Laterality refers to the side of a paired organ or the side of the body where the primary tumor originates. It indicates whether cancer occurs on one side (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral) of paired organs, such as the breasts, kidneys, or lungs.  
Derivation of Laterality will take into consideration focality, where focality describes the number of tumor sites within an affected organ—unifocal (a single tumor) or multifocal (multiple tumors).  
When combined, laterality may differ

* *Unilateral unifocal* cancer indicates a single tumor in one side of a paired organ.  
* *Unilateral multifocal* cancer involves multiple tumors on one side of a paired organ.  
* *Bilateral multifocal* cancer involves tumors in both sides of a paired organ, with multiple tumors on each side.

### ***Hierarchy of Documents (Unifocal)***

Record Unifocal Laterality based on the following hierarchy of source documents:

1. **MD Note, Imaging, and/or Pathology**  
   1. Use the MD note assessment and plan, imaging and pathology source documents separately or in concordance with each other to assign laterality  
2. **ICD-10 C Code**  
   1. Use the ICD-10 C code to determine the laterality  
   2. The number(s) following the "." in the C code will help identify laterality

### ***Hierarchy of Documents (Systemic)***

Record Systemic Laterality based on the following hierarchy of source documents:

4. **MD Note**  
   1. Use the laterality designated by the MD in the assessment and plan  
4. **ICD-10 C Code**  
   1. Use the ICD-10 C code to determine the laterality  
   2. The number(s) following the "." in the C code will help identify laterality (Reference known structure of an ICD-10-CM Code)

## ***Metastatic Status***

Metastatic Status refers to the prognostic group Stage IV. TNM does not have to be given to record the metastatic status and Stage IV disease can be implied and confirmed by the physician within the MD Note. The patient will not return to a non-metastatic state after confirmation of Stage IV disease, even after treatment.  
You may utilize the AJCC staging rule that any Stage IV patient is considered metastatic, and any stages other than Stage IV are considered non-metastatic.  
Depending on the location of lymph node chain involvement (distant vs regional), the patient *can* be considered metastatic Stage IV (i.e. in prostate cancer). Staging information from the AJCC Manual is summarized in the NCCN Guidelines.  
Metastatic disease is typically identified through imaging reports, which provide critical insights into its presence and extent. Clinical manifestations may also be used to infer Stage IV disease.  
Metastatic status will not be collected by the VPP for hematological malignancies.

### ***Hierarchy of Documents***

Metastatic Status is derived based on the following hierarchy of source documents:

2. **MD Note**  
   1. The MD must explicitly state the patient has Stage IV or "distant" metastatic disease in their assessment and plan  
   2. The VPP should not assume metastatic disease based on radiologist interpretation of imaging alone  
   3. The term ‘metastatic’ may be present in the MD note, but it may or may not in regards to distant metastatic disease (i.e. micrometastasis)  
2. **Surgical Pathology Report**  
   1. The surgical pathology report must include a TNM Staging with an M stage greater than ≥ pM1 (with some exceptions)  
   2. Prostate, testicular and some head and neck cancers may not meet the typical requirements for Stage IV disease, refer to NCCN Guidelines for confirmation of metastatic disease

## ***Biomarkers***

Biomarkers are biological molecules, such as proteins, genes, or other substances, that can be used to provide information about a person's cancer. They can be used to estimate risk of developing cancer,  predict response to therapy, monitor for disease recurrence and response or progression in metastatic disease.

### ***Hierarchy of Documents***

Genetic testing reports and MD Notes can be used in conjunction with each other. Both sources should be evaluated to include ALL relevant biomarkers. They are not mutually exclusive.  
Record Biomarkers based on cross-reference of the following source documents:

* **Genetic Testing Reports**  
  * Document pertinent positive and negative findings  
  * Guidelines for certain indications will be documented for all patients are found in the Biomarkers section of this document  
* **MD Note**  
  * Include all instances of MD mention of biomarkers

## ***Medical Oncology***

### ***Surgery***

Surgery includes any operational procedure intended to remove cancer. This can be to the primary site or to a metastatic site. Biopsies and Fine Needle Aspirations are not considered Surgical procedures.

### ***Hierarchy of Documents***

Record Surgery based on the following hierarchy of source documents:

1. **Operative Report and/or Pathology Report**  
   1. These will have the same procedure/collection date needed for documentation purposes  
2. **MD Note**  
   1. Include all instances of MD mention of date of surgery, surgical procedure name, and pathology findings (if applicable)  
   2. Mention instances if a patient is ineligible for surgery.

### ***Radiation Therapy***

Radiation Therapy (RT) is a treatment that uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Examples of types of radiation therapy are: External Beam Radiation Therapy (i.e. IMRT, SBRT, Y-90, etc.), Brachytherapy, Total Body Irradiation, Stereotactic Radiotherapy (i.e. Gamma knife, Cyberknife, etc.).

### ***Hierarchy of Documents***

Record RT information based on the following hierarchy of source documents:

2. **Radiation Oncology MD Treatment Summary**  
   1. Include all instances of Rad Onc mention of delivered radiation therapy  
2. **Medical Oncology MD Note**  
   1. Include all instances of Med Onc mention of delivered radiation therapy.  
   2. Mention instances if a patient is ineligible for radiation treatment.

### ***Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT)***

SACT (Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy) is a general term for any drug treatment used to treat or control cancer. SACT includes chemotherapy (conventional or cytotoxic), hormone therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy can be received by the patient orally or through intravenous infusion.

### ***Hierarchy of Documents***

#### ***Oral SACT***

Record Oral SACT information based on the following hierarchy of source documents:

2. **MD Note**  
   1. MD may use subjective terms such as "patient started/stopped medication on \[Date\]," or "patient stated they started/stopped the medication 2 days ago"  
   2. If MD reports the patient started/stopped a medication "X" days ago, use the visit date and subtract the number of days from the visit date to derive the medication start date  
   3. Mention instances if a patient is ineligible for SACT treatment, and what the reason was if known.  
2. **Nursing Notes/Reports or Patient Communication Records**  
   1. Any mention of start date and/or end date and medication name  
2. **Prescription**  
   1. Use the earliest date of prescription sent or filled as the start date  
   2. If mention of medication completion, use the latest prescription date and add the number of doses dispensed to derive the medication end date

   2. Be mindful that at times the MAR will show planned doses, although they may have never been administered.  
2. **MD Note**  
   1. MD may use subjective terms such as "patient started/stopped medication on \[date\]," "patient received cycle 1 on \[date\]"  
   2. If MD reports the patient started/stopped a medication "X" days ago, use the visit date and subtract the number of days from the visit date to derive the medication start date

### ***Clinical Trials***

Clinical Trials are research studies where people with cancer volunteer to test new treatments, procedures, or drugs to determine if they are safe and effective against their specific cancer type.
